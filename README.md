# FCC Pomodoro Clock
###### Project that is part of the FreeCodeCamp front-end curriculum
###### In order to complete the project I had to follow this brief:
- I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
- I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
- I can customise the length of each pomodoro.
